# Automatically Mount SD Card

## Hardware Requirements
This app doesn't require any specific hardware logic

## Usage
- Create this app in your PetaLinux project: `petalinux-create -t apps -n fstab_mount_sd --template install --enable`
- Copy the files from this directory into your local project's `components/apps/fstab_mount_sd/`
- Build your image: `petalinux-build`
- If your image has been built, you can build only this app and install it to target file system:

```
petalinux-build -c rootfs/fstab_mount_sd
petalinux-build -x package
```
